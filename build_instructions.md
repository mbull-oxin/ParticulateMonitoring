How to build an Oxin style particulate monitor in the sealed case.

## Preperation ##

What you will need - 

Screwdrivers for the screws you have sourced, double sided 3M tape 5mm (see consumables tab in BOM), a 5mm drill, and a stepped bit capable of drilling out to 25mm (plus of course a drill)

Print the 3d files out in PLA or PETG and install M2.5 heatset inserts to the mounting holes for the raspberry pi.

Using the drill guide with 2 holes, drill the guided 5mm holes on the end with double base posts, the drill guide should index on the internal rib, then open up the holes to 25mm with the stepped bit.

Using the drill guide with one hole drill a hole on the right hand side (bottom with the vents towards you) one from the top between the internal ribs, then open out to 20mm with the stepped bit.
